00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,694
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:01,782 --> 00:00:02,798
Hyundai is one of

3
00:00:02,814 --> 00:00:03,766
the most iconic

4
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:04,614
companies to enter

5
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:06,318
the indian markets.

6
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:07,422
It is hard to

7
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:08,398
believe that a south

8
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:09,870
korean brand, which

9
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,022
was once a difficult

10
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:12,078
name to pronounce,

11
00:00:12,174 --> 00:00:13,166
is today about to

12
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:13,974
launch the biggest

13
00:00:14,022 --> 00:00:15,254
ipo in the history

14
00:00:15,302 --> 00:00:16,790
of India. Indian

15
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,854
stock markets could

16
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:18,614
soon see their

17
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:20,158
biggest ever ipo.

18
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:21,158
South korean

19
00:00:21,214 --> 00:00:22,462
automaker Hyundai is

20
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:23,366
gearing up for a

21
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:23,854
significant

22
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,094
milestone by going

23
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:26,490
public in India.

24
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,286
Hyundai's ipo is

25
00:00:28,318 --> 00:00:29,158
poised to be one of

26
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:30,030
the largest in

27
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,006
recent times,

28
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:31,990
potentially the

29
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,430
biggest ipo ever in

30
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,006
India. This would be

31
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:36,574
India's largest ipo

32
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:37,638
and the first ven

33
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:38,526
automaker since

34
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:39,782
Maruti Suzuki in

35
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,718
2003. In 1996,

36
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:43,862
when Hyundai entered

37
00:00:43,886 --> 00:00:45,150
the indian market,

38
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,582
Maridi was the most

39
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:47,662
dominant player with

40
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:49,670
a 60% market share,

41
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,070
almost a monopoly

42
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,846
amongst the middle

43
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:53,158
class in India.

44
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:54,262
Despite this,

45
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:55,430
Hyundai came in with

46
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,742
models like Santro,

47
00:00:56,846 --> 00:00:58,654
I ten, I 20 and

48
00:00:58,702 --> 00:00:59,926
Krita making a

49
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,330
significant impact.

50
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,118
Today, Hyundai is

51
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:04,158
the second largest

52
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:05,086
automaker in the

53
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:05,678
country with a

54
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:08,206
profit of 4653

55
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:10,126
crores. In terms of

56
00:01:10,158 --> 00:01:10,942
profitability,

57
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:12,190
Hyundai is way ahead

58
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,270
of Maruti in FY two

59
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,470
three. While Hyundai

60
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,438
made a profit of

61
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:19,606
rs65,355 per

62
00:01:19,638 --> 00:01:20,798
vehicle, Maruti made

63
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,982
a profit of rs4939

64
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:25,914
per vehicle. Now,

65
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,554
after 28 years of

66
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:28,426
establishing a

67
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,290
stronghold in the

68
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,282
indian market,

69
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:31,466
Hyundai plans to

70
00:01:31,498 --> 00:01:33,306
raise 25,000 crores

71
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:34,354
with its ipo.

72
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:35,930
Sounds fantastic,

73
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,386
right? However,

74
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:38,250
there are some

75
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,370
hidden risks that

76
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,650
Hyundai faces which

77
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,762
may jeopardize all

78
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:42,666
the progress they've

79
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:44,538
made in India. All

80
00:01:44,554 --> 00:01:45,770
of this is detailed

81
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,962
in a 436 page dear

82
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:49,122
HP paper that

83
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:50,226
Hyundai filed with S

84
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:51,956
EbI. We've gone

85
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:52,716

86
00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:53,716
data so that you can

87
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:54,932
sit back and consume

88
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:55,700
the most important

89
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,892
bits of this 400

90
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:58,084
page document as

00:01:58,132 --> 00:01:59,532
easily as watching a

92
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:00,724
movie. In this

93
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:02,036
episode, let's dive

94
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:02,940
into understanding

95
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,940
how a south korean

96
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,940
company like Hyundai

97
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,740
broke into the

98
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,868
indian automobile

99
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:08,004
market, leaving

100
00:02:08,052 --> 00:02:09,076
behind giants like

101
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:10,920
Tata and Mahindra.

102
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,292
Despite being a

103
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,236
foreign company,

104
00:02:13,388 --> 00:02:14,260
how did Hyundai

105
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,276
achieve such high

106
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:16,308
profitability and

107
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:17,444
outpace a mammoth

108
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:18,444
like Maruti in

109
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:19,638
India? Most

110
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:20,878
importantly, after

111
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:22,094
making such amazing

112
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,478
progress, what are

113
00:02:23,494 --> 00:02:24,358
the hidden risks

114
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:25,142
that could topple

115
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,070
Hyundai's growth in

116
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,998
India? Also, a quick

117
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:29,446
disclaimer. I am not

118

Now on with the

205
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:18,258
episode. The first

206
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:19,106
thing you need to

207
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:20,042
understand about a

208
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:21,050
company is their

209
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:21,954
philosophy of

210
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:23,730
success. In this

211
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,826
case, you need to

212
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:25,618
understand what

213
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:26,546
exactly is the

214
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:27,450
philosophy that

215
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,450
turned Hyundai into

216
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,730
what it is today in

217
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,290
India. Like we saw

218
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,506
in the Boeing video,

219
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:33,706
no matter how much

220
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:34,538
profitability,

221
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,320
EBITDA or earnings

222
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,216
per share a company

223
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:38,576
has, if it deviates

224
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:39,176
from its core

225
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,376
philosophy, all

226
00:04:40,408 --> 00:04:41,376
these numbers will

227
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:43,384
go for a toss. So

228
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:44,432
lets understand the

229
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:45,616
core philosophy and

230
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:46,536
then move on to

231
00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:47,328
profitability,

232
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:49,032
EBITDA and other

233
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:50,336
numbers. Now the

234
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:51,632
question is what

235
00:04:51,696 --> 00:04:52,616
exactly is the

236
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:53,696
secret recipe for

237
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:55,064
Hyundais success in

238
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:56,912
India? This story

239
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:57,840
dates back to the

240
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,912
early 1990s. Until

241
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:01,016
this point, India

242
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:02,240
only had a few car

243
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,472
brands, Hindustan,

244
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,264
Ambassador,

245
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:05,584
Contessa, Premier,

246
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:06,950
Padmini, Standard

247
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,046
Herald 2000, Maridi

248
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:11,190
